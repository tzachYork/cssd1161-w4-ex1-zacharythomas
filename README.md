I am Zachary Thomas, I am in my 3rd year at york university. I am enrolled in the educational studies program with hopes of becoming a high school teacher once I graduate. I am also taking Japanese as a minor as well. 
I am looking to learn how to effectively communicate through group projects which should allow for more success later on in life.
